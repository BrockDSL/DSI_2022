# Digital Scholarship Institute 2022

[**Register for DSI 2022**](https://forms.office.com/r/Rcff0pZqG4)

## When

- Tuesday May 3, 9:00 - 2:45
- Wednesday May 4, 9:00 - 2:45
- Thursday May 5, 9:00 - 11:00


## Objectives

The DSI is a three day, immersive, and interactive workshop that focuses on a core set of methodologies and tools that provide both a knowledge base and the confidence to create assignments that reflect the changing nature of teaching and learning in higher-ed. 

By the end of this institute, participants will:

- Identify the hallmarks of digital scholarship/critical elements and methodological principles that qualify scholarly work as digital scholarship 

- Demonstrate understanding of reusable assignments and open pedagogy by experimenting with new assignment ideas 

- Envision digital scholarship as a collaborative venture between instructors, local campus experts, such as librarians and professionals in CPI, with whom they feel confident working to develop high-impact assignments to further student learning 

- Establish a cohort as part of this institute to cultivate knowledge sharing and on-going support during and following the institute 


## How the Institute will Function


Normally, the Institute would meet in-person and take advantage of the newly updated Digital Scholarship Lab space in the Rankin Family Pavilion. For this iteration of the Institute, programming will occur synchronously over Teams. As the schedule below shows, there are two types of sessions: **group sessions**, where each participant and facilitator will meet, and **stream sessions**, where participants will meet only with colleagues interested in the same stream. **Group sessions** will feature content that is applicable to each stream, while **Stream sessions** will focus on the particularities of the stream’s main methodology. In this way, we hope that participants will be able to benefit from the insight of the larger group, while also develop a specialized cohort within streams. 

Each 45-minute session is interrupted by a 15-minute break (we encourage you to take full advantage of these breaks). **Please know that** we recognize that participating in a virtual 2.5-day Institute brings with it is own challenges, in addition to the added pressures of working from home. You are not required to be “on” the entire time. We ask that you try to attend and participate during **group sessions**. During **Stream sessions**, facilitators and other subject experts will be available for consultation. If you face challenges, or want to bounce ideas off others, **Stream sessions** are a perfect opportunity to iron out your chosen project. 

**Building on DSI 2021, DSI 2022 will feature two types of learning streams: long streams and short streams.**  

**Long streams** will run for the length of the institute (from Day 1 to Day 3). Participants will commit to participating in all three days. This format is the same as DSI2021. 

**Short streams**, on the other hand, will run for half a day (Day 1 morning, Day 1 afternoon, Day 2 morning, Day 2 afternoon). Participants can sign up for one or more short streams but will not be able to participate in a long stream. 

## Long streams 

**Digital Exhibits with CollectionBuilder and Github Pages (Instructor: Daniel Brett)** 

Digital exhibits are an excellent way to share and display metadata rich materials digital objects. They are particularly useful in bringing to life digitized material to reach a wider audience. Attendees will dig into the digital exhibit platform CollectionBuilder. This platform is totally web-based and easy to work with. The only requirement is the collection of digital objects that will be showcased. For an example of a fully developed CollectionBuilder site please consult Brock Geodata Listing site. 

**Mapping and GIS with ArcGIS (Instructor: Sharon Janzen)** 

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to analyze, display and communicate data that contains a geospatial component. This stream will present two major GIS inspired tools: ArcGIS Online, a lightweight internet-based application that allows you to create interactive maps and Esri StoryMaps, which combines interactive maps with narrative text, graphic images and other multimedia content to portray your story to the world. Attendees will gain hands-on experience with these two platforms with the end goal of creating a compelling interactive story map. For an example of this technology in action please have a look at the 2020 Esri scholarship winning story map If Coastlines could Talk. 

**Programming for Humanists — Jupyter (Instructors: Dr. Aaron Mauro)**

## Short Streams

**LMS Showcase (Instructor: TBA)**  
*Information coming soon!*

**Pressbooks (Instructor: TBA)**  
*Information coming soon!*

**H5P Studio (Instructor: TBA)**  
*Information coming soon!*

**Social Annotation (Instructor: Tim Ribaric)**

 

Close reading is an analysis method that helps facilitate an in-depth understanding of a piece of text. The difficulty arises when trying to conduct a close reading exercise in a classroom environment. Attendees will explore [Hypothes.is]( https://web.hypothes.is/): a web-based tool that allows a group to collaboratively read through and annotate a document in real time. Simply by providing a link or uploading a PDF a group can create an environment that allows for an engaging and rich platform to pour over a body of text. The platform can also be natively embedded into Sakai making for a seamless integration with other course work. See the power of Hypothes.is in action with this marked up rendition of [The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]( https://via.hypothes.is/https://www.bartleby.com/101/549.html).
