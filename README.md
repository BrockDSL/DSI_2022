# Digital Scholarship Institute 2022


## When

- Tuesday May 3, 9:00 - 2:45
- Wednesday May 4, 9:00 - 2:45
- Thursday May 5, 9:00 - 11:00


## Objectives

The DSI is a three day, immersive, and interactive workshop that focuses on a core set of methodologies and tools that provide both a knowledge base and the confidence to create assignments that reflect the changing nature of teaching and learning in higher-ed.

By the end of this institute, participants will

- Demonstrate confidence in their ability to engage with digital scholarship projects by **developing a reusable assignment** for an upcoming course

- Identify the hallmarks of digital scholarship/critical elements and  methodological principles that qualifies scholarly work as digital scholarship

- Explain the qualities of three specific streams within digital scholarship: GIS mapping; annotation; digital exhibits

- Envision digital scholarship as a collaborative venture between instructors, local campus experts, such as librarians and professionals in CPI, with whom they feel confident working to develop high-impact assignments to further student learning

- Establish a cohort as part of this institute to cultivate knowledge sharing and on-going support during and following the institute



## How the Institute will Function


Normally, the Institute would meet in-person and take advantage of the newly  updated Digital Scholarship Lab space in the Rankin Family Pavilion. For this iteration of the Institute, programming will occur synchronously over Zoom / Teams. As the schedule below shows, there are two types of sessions: <span style="color:orange">**group sessions**</span>, where each participant and facilitator will meet, and <span style="color:red">**stream sessions**</span>, where participants will meet only with colleagues interested in the same stream. <span style="color:orange">**Group sessions**</span> will feature content that is applicable to each stream, while <span style="color:red">**Stream sessions**</span> will focus on the particularities of the stream’s main methodology. In this way, we hope that participants will be able to benefit from the insight of the larger group, while also develop a specialized cohort within streams.

Each 45-minute session is interrupted by a 15-minute break (we encourage you to take full advantage of these breaks). **Please know that** we recognize that participating in a virtual 2.5-day Institute brings with it is own challenges, in addition to the added pressures of working from home. You are not required to be “on” the entire time. We ask that you try to attend and participate during <span style="color:orange">**group sessions**</span>. During <span style="color:red">**Stream sessions**</span>, facilitators and other subject experts will be available for consultation. If you face challenges, or want to bounce ideas off others, <span style="color:red">**Stream sessions**</span> are a perfect opportunity to iron out your chosen project.
